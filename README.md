# AI Rap Battle Application

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered rap battle application that pits two AI models against each other in a multi-round rap battle. Initially, I used **Anthropic's Claude**, but due to limitations (Claude being unable to generate rap content because it deemed it too violent), I switched to using **Cohere** for generating the rap lines. The application also integrates **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo** for the other part of the battle (cause I'm poor ðŸ˜­, apparently  ).

The project includes a **NestJS** backend for orchestrating the rap battles and a **React** frontend to display the ongoing rap battle.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: NestJS
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3 / Vue / Typescript
- **AI Models**:
  - **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo**
  - **Cohere Command R+**

## Documentation Links

Here are the documentation resources used for integrating OpenAI and Cohere:

- [OpenAI Text Generation Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/quickstart)
- [Cohere Chat API Documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/chat-api)

## Running the Application

### Backend

The backend, built with **NestJS**, streams responses between OpenAI and Cohere, simulating a rap battle based on a given theme. You can test the backend by accessing the following endpoint:

- **Backend Endpoint**:

  - `http://localhost:3000/rap-battle/stream?theme=your_theme`

  Replace `your_theme` with the desired theme for the rap battle.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using **React** and interacts with the backend to display the rap battle between the two AI models. You can view the frontend at the following address:

- **Frontend URL**:
  - `http://localhost:3001/`

## How It Works

1. A user inputs a theme for the rap battle.
2. The backend coordinates between **OpenAI** and **Cohere** by sending and receiving responses, alternating between the two models.
3. The frontend displays the rap lines generated by both models in real-time.
4. Initially, **Anthropic's Claude** was tested, but it was later replaced by **Cohere** due to Claude's limitations in handling rap content, especially when the content was flagged as too violent.

## Running Locally

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your `.env` file with your API keys for OpenAI and Cohere:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
COHERE_API_KEY=your-cohere-api-key
PORT=3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

```bash
cd backend
pnpm install
pnpm run start:dev
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```
